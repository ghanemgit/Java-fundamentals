### Today I learn more about how to use IntelliJ and create directory, and I'm tried to create project from command line, and I found that amazing and look for more about string type also I am learned about how to stop execution of function for certain time here using Thread Class [from java doc](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html) This Task take with me about 2 Hours.
### In this lab I had three method to solve, So I solved this three method, Here are their name:

#### 2)Flip N Heads.

#### 3)Clock.


# Lab02
### Ok today is happy day because I'm done my tasks quickly you know why? ok, I will tell you, for first time Iam using the debugger tools I said oobs why I ignored an important thing like this I was surprised from the amount of ease with which the debugger tools gives us so today  learned great thing this task take 45min with me , thanks.
### The method that I was solved is:
#### 1)Roll.

#### 2)Calculating Averages.

#### 3)Contains Duplicates.

#### 4)Arrays Of Arrays(two-dimensional array).



# Lab03
### I learned how to use maps, sets, hashmap and hash set and what can I do by the objects from these classes like add, get, remove, and other edits also I do some applied on it in this lab.
### And I learned a lot about write, read, and path of file and how I can delay with different files and different path's and what is packages and classes used in this process.
### I solved this method:
#### 1)Analyzing Weather Data.

#### 2)Tally.

# Lab06
#### In this lab I learned how to create class and create its properties(variables,fields), also I generate its constructor and pass all arguments for it, after that I learned how to create interface and all empty method inside it.
#### So what I do in this lab is 
- Create Restaurant class and its properties and constructors.
- Create Review class and its properties and constructors.
- Create Review form instance and its Method.
- Connect between Restaurant and Review by add review method.
- Do all test.
 
# Lab07
### In this lab I increase my experience with all about inheritance and know the difference between inheritance and composition, and I learned how to connect the classes together more effectively.
### So what I do in this lab is
- Create Shop class and write its constructor and add review method and do its tests.
- Create Theater class and write its constructor and add, remove and review methods and do all implementation for it as required and do its tests.

#### You can go to this path and run gradle test directly
